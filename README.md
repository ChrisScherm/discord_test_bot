# Test Bot for Discord 

## This bot uses APIs to send gifs, reply to Discord messages and give current weather for some cities

This bot uses three APIs:

- The Discord API to connect with Discord Servers: https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro
- The tenor API to find gifs: https://tenor.com/gifapi/documentation
- The OpenWeather API to fetch weather data (only works for Menlo Park, Los Angeles and New York): https://openweathermap.org/api
